# Math UI Research

Ongoing research into the following question:

> What is the most elegant UI for writing mathematical formulas on a
> mobile device?

The motivation for answering this question came from my own
experience taking the [“Introduction to Mathematical Thinking”][1]
course on Coursera. I wanted to complete coursework assignments from
the comfort of my iPhone, reasoning that the more convenient I can
make it, the more likely I am to do the work.

I got quite far using Apple Notes and [SciKey][2] but the experience
of writing mathematical formulas (even simple ones) remained
cumbersome, error-prone and frustrating even after weeks of daily
practice.

My next line of investigation is into auto-completion. Would a
specialized keyboard that offered a choice of next-most-likely
mathematical expressions be effective? How would such a thing work?
Can ML and NLP techniques like word2vec be applied to mathematical
constructions?
